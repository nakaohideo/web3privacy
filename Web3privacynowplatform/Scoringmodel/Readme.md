Scoring model analytics based on a 50+ privacy projects [survey](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JWpAsGL10UTsVeuIVbouzUxRjaSPUAamxcbFljXuUWE/edit?usp=sharing)

**Approach**:
- we made a survey on how privacy projects recommend analysing if they are private or not.
- answers were assembled into 1 Excel sheet to be further analysed

**Fileverse**	
Answers:
- open sourcing our work
- you literally generate and download your own e2ee keys
- documentation
- social recovery options

_Observations_: 
- open source non-techies should know what "open source" means & how to measure it (solution: Open source 101 education)
- key ownership is another knowledge person should know (contrast: Google or Meta "owns" your ID/key) + e2ee 101 is a must here
- clicking on the documentation link & understanding it are different skills
- social recovery is a less techy assessment & is linked to a persona (data ownership)

_Product feature_
- open source 101 (short version)
- e2ee 101
- documentation: exists/missing (+/-)
- social recovery 101

Answers:
- starting with our litepaper	
- further questions feel free to drop them in our discord

_Observations_:
- "read the docs" is a popular answer without any third-party attestation that docs are correct, care for privacy etc
- Discord serves as a two-way comms platform (but depends on the project) & it creates additional dependence of user on the core team

_Product feature_
- in the future: collab with a security audit companies to create a new docs audit service description when a third-party will attest privacy-features of the initial idea x tooling description

Answers:
- Check their website or docs	
- If they vaguely say “data is kept private” and provide no explanation how, run	
- If they provide an explanation, check with an expert or DYOR

_Observations_:
- "check" is a highly abstract action related to the website or docs -> extract value should be related to understanding "privacy"-validity markers
- "private data explainers" needed to be defined within use-cases (case studies for the market


_Product feature:_rk
- website checklist (1-2-3-4-5..., yes/no validity)
- case studies "private data" explainers
- DYOR (that's our platform)
