# Scoring model analytics based on a 50+ privacy projects [survey](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JWpAsGL10UTsVeuIVbouzUxRjaSPUAamxcbFljXuUWE/edit?usp=sharing)

**Approach**:
- we made a survey on how privacy projects recommend analysing if they are private or not.
- answers were assembled into 1 Excel sheet to be further analysed

**Fileverse**	

Answers:
- open sourcing our work
- you literally generate and download your own e2ee keys
- documentation
- social recovery options

_Observations_: 
- open source non-techies should know what "open source" means & how to measure it (solution: Open source 101 education)
- key ownership is another knowledge person should know (contrast: Google or Meta "owns" your ID/key) + e2ee 101 is a must here
- clicking on the documentation link & understanding it are different skills
- social recovery is a less techy assessment & is linked to a persona (data ownership)

_Product feature_
- open source 101 (short version)
- e2ee 101
- documentation: exists/missing (+/-)
- social recovery 101

**Lava Network**	

Answers:
- starting with our litepaper	
- further questions feel free to drop them in our discord

_Observations_:
- "read the docs" is a popular answer without any third-party attestation that docs are correct, care for privacy etc
- Discord serves as a two-way comms platform (but depends on the project) & it creates additional dependence of user on the core team

_Product feature_
- in the future: collab with a security audit companies to create a new docs audit service description when a third-party will attest privacy-features of the initial idea x tooling description

**Holonym**	

Answers:
- Check their website or docs	
- If they vaguely say “data is kept private” and provide no explanation how, run	
- If they provide an explanation, check with an expert or DYOR

_Observations_:
- "check" is a highly abstract action related to the website or docs -> extract value should be related to understanding "privacy"-validity markers
- "private data explainers" needed to be defined within use-cases (case studies for the market)


_Product feature_:
- website checklist (1-2-3-4-5..., yes/no validity)
- case studies "private data" explainers
- DYOR (that's our platform)

**Spinner cash**	

Answers
- code is law. 
- So how about "don't trust, verify"?	But to verify, it would require certain technical skills... like reading source code 😅	
- We hope to bring in 3rd party auditors at some point

_Observations_:
- the more ideological language is on the website - the harder to navigate the factual privacy features 
- source code reading is a highly technical skill (moreover: Ethereum dev could struggle with Solana code & vice versa)
- 3rd party list is needed here to be transformed into privacy signalling features

_Product feature_:
- missing 3rd party audit potential risks 101
- 3rd party list (yes/no) from security audit agencies to independent security engineers (+their reputation 101 in later versions)

**Session**	

Answers
- There is the Session code audit	
- See what's being said in (non-paid) media: reviews, articles, etc.

_Observations_:
- existing audit is a plus (even if code could be updated, audit could be partial etc)
- hard to define non-paid media placements, but existing media credibility (reco by trusted people like Vitalik - is a plus)

_Product feature_:
- code audit (yes/no). Case studies (how those audits could look alike with active links)
- simplified media analysis 101

**ZKBob**

Answers
- whether the solution forces users to preserve their privacy or if it's the user's responsibility. For example, Tornado Cash increases anonymity by requiring users to deposit a specific amount but doesn't require using different addresses for withdrawals	
- zkBOB doesn't force specific amounts or address usage, but encourages the use of new withdrawal addresses by rewarding them with a small amount of native coins that can be used in the next transaction to pay for gas.	
- How the components of the protocol communicate with each other and if users can replace any components is another important aspect.	
- In the case of zkBOB, the pool contracts are the core component, and the user needs to trust the zkBOB development team regarding privacy leaks in the rest of infrastructure: UI and the sequencer. However, the project roadmap includes plans to address these concerns.	
- Since privacy-preserving solutions on the blockchain involve complex mathematical concepts that may be difficult for non-techie individuals to understand, there will always be trust assumptions for this part of the solution.	
- "The only way for non-techie people to reduce risks is to seek expert advice or do extensive research before using such solutions. 
- For zkBOB, it's worth noting that the project is open source, the part of the protocol related to zero-knowledge was audited, and the team does its best to support documentation that's up-to-date and clear for ordinary users."

_Observations_:
- interesting approach opposite to "optional privacy" - push the person to gain privacy by performing extra actions, so privacy will be "tangible"
- privacy culture could be gamified & serve as a privacy 101 (new withdrawal addresses generation)
- "protocol components" are highly-techy issues to track
- ZK decentralisation (to be achieved) should be communicated (if you don't trust project team - that's a risk)
- trust assumption should be expanded within 101 (where exactly person "delegate" trust to the project)
- audit & trust assumptions could co-exist in 1 project, but it's critical to understand risk categories for each component of "trust"/"privacy" relations

_Product feature_:
- trust assumptions 101
- privacy in ZK 101
- later on - case studies when solutions actively embed privacy education within the workflow

**Litentry**	

Answers:
- you can start by reading Litentry’s explainers first	
- then maybe then read through other privacy solutions to make the comparison?

Observations:
- explainers could explain privacy features but should be helpful to make self-research (to be investigated)
- not many privacy projects compare themselves within privacy features (extreme exception: Samurai team attack Wasabi) - opportunity for us

_Product feature_
- future: privacy features comparison within solutions (creating a comprehensive privacy market metrics set)

**BrightID**

Answers:
- You could rationalize from the fact that it does not ask you for any personally identifying information directly, so there is nothing to preserve and keep it safe in its infrastructure.	
- technical things you could ask a technical person you trust to look at its oss code.		

_Observations:_
- if there's nothing to ask - there's  nothing to hide, - interesting assumption, but services could collect data without asking (like IP)
- need extra technical help to analyse the code (potential for a privacy QA automation)

_Product features:_
- privacy data leakages 101

**Swarm**	

Answers
- reading our whitepaper, which provides a comprehensive overview of Swarm's technology and how it achieves privacy	

_Observations_:
- whitepaper is too "heavy" instrument for people with a short attention span & in need of quick attestations. Moreover, it's not up to date, usually

_Product feature_
- web3 docs 101 (basic description in relation to privacy)	

**Railgun**	

Answers
- Use @Railway_xyz to send a private transfer to a 0zk address through a Relayer. 	
- Examine the "receipt" of that transfer on etherscan or arbiscan.  You will not find: (1) sender, (2) receiver, (3) token or (4) amount anywhere in the transaction receipt.	
- There's a ton a technical person can do to verify but there's also a litmus test of #privacy that anyone can do. https://t.co/PqkUJWwmPD	
- "This is a 0zk -> 0zk transaction (sending tokens from one #DeFi user to another. 
- You'll note in the scan has a from address but this is simply a Relayer address that pays gas to process the on-chain computation.	
- User communications with a Relayer are passed via through the @waku_org p2p gossip network, so Relayers can't know a particular message origin. 
- In other words, even here #privacy was a big consideration throughout the tech stack not just on Etherscan.	
- The To address is simply the RAILGUN smart contract on @0xPolygon in this case. So nothing is revealed about the recipient.
- The value that exchanged hands? #Private
- Try to decode the input data for the transaction? It's all #encrypted.
- So how much money exchanged hands here? Well, the short answer here is - it's #private. Only the sender and recipient will know. There will be #zeroknowledge about it unless they choose to reveal the transaction information.

_Observations_
- general web3 101 are needed for person to self-check privacy

**Penumbra**	

Answers:
- maybe look for people you trust that are able to analyze the technical solution for its privacy merits and then get their opinion ? it's prob difficult to analyze a technical protocol with a non-technical analysis.	
- what you're asking about relates to a more holistic assessment of a protocol and its attributes, so that should be within the scope of a research function moreso than a security audit function.

**HOPR**	

Answers:
- FOSS. Free & Open Source Software is the foundation that enables you to check whatever you want. The hoprd client is released under GPLv3 license that allows you to do that (and also modify and re-distribute) hoprd freely: GitHub"	
- Code quality. Open source code should be readable to be helpful to you! To that end we enforce code quality via linters for Typescript
https://github.com/hoprnet/hoprnet/blob/df7bc88517329472adbfe73bd4a22bddd5cfbcc9/package.json#L46… and for our Rust code: https://github.com/hoprnet/hoprnet/blob/master/rustfmt.toml…
- Tools. So far we released tools such as http://DERP.hoprnet.org or http://mint.hoprnet.org (which in turn are obviously also FOSS!) that show shortcomings of existing technologies. We will keep building such tools also for HOPR itself."	"The exact checks you'd do depend on the application that actually use HOPR

E.g. on #RPCh we're thinking of installing a VPN server on the RPCh exit node which would visualize requests via DERP: https://twitter.com/hoprnet/status/1596896868377792520"	If you want to go hardcore, you could use a packet inspection tool such as #Wireshark to check all packets coming into your machine and going out	
- You will notice that you cannot tell anything from these packets - thanks to the Sphinx packet format that we use at HOPR:

**Waku**	

Answers:
- rfc.vac.dev is a good start. The RFC repository contains the specification of Waku and other protocols. In terms of @ethstatus's privacy claims. It is good to first look at the base layer: @waku_org
- The RFCs describe the protocol and also contain security assumptions/guarantees section."	
- The target audience are researchers and maintainers of Waku implementations. Not the easiest thing to read!

**Rotki**	

Answers:
- Don't think u can. Gotta trust either me or someone who can read code	"The simplest thing a non-techie person can understand is:
- Local application with all data stored in a local encrypted database (private by design)"	
- Opensource, so your techy friend can see we are not lying. It really isn't complicated imo.
- To be 100% sure read code	
- But it does not take an expert to understand that an application that you download, run locally and keeps all data locally is 1000x more private than a webapp
- We have been brainwashed to calling webapps, as "apps" now.

**Webb**	

Answers:
- you need to analyze the data they create through transactions. If that data (and metadata) can be analyzed for patterns then that can help define the degree of privacy of the solution.	
- For our bridge solution, this is akin to rebuilding the tx graph and seeing if flows through such a graph can be identified. The main actions in our system are deposit, transfers, and withdrawals. We use the same zero knowledge proof based ideas to make it harder to track…

**KILT Protocol**	

Answers:
"KILT preserves privacy in the same way paper or plastic credentials do:

1. they are not stored on any central entity but totally decentralised in the wallets of their owners. 
2. users decide for what reason they share a credential with whom. 
3. one can share credentials partially"	A DID is created on the user‘s device. Like your blockchain keypair. It’s an identifier like your face, your fingerprint or your signature. It’s not issued by any entity. This way it’s always decentralised and does not have a decentralisation status.

**Privacy & Scalability**	

Answers:
- one approach might be looking at the public data from the system. If you see user identifiers being used only once that's perhaps helpful? But a non-technical person doesn't know if identifiers are true random, or if they're backdoored somehow.	
- With the unirep protocol we're building an explorer that shows all the things happening in the system. So a user could see their epoch keys and attestations and see how they're distinct in the system. One thing we might do is write what can and can't be determined about the different identifiers.

- user education would absolutely be how. 
- To be fair lokinet's docs arent really there rn, it's always on the todo list and never really gets done.	
- once you do all the user education you can, you get to the point where you see that privacy is more of a bonus to seal the deal than a primary feature from the perspective of the consumer grade user.	
- ideally we dont want lokinet to leak anything at all. 
- net usage statistics tools from projects like pihole provide great visualizations for some of it.

**nix-bitcoin**	

Answers:
- For one, you need to be fairly technical to setup nix-bitcoin at this point.	
- One important aspect is whether all outbound connections are tunnelled through Tor by default. 
- You could check the generated configuration files. For example, make sure that proxy=127.0.0.1:9050 is in fact set in /var/lib/bitcoind/bitcoin.conf.				

_Observations_: 
- if a product requires tech proficiency - it's important to highlight it (entry-level into tech understanding)
- Tor is a plus1 to privacy, but not a silver bullet (important to understand "privacy enhancement" & not just "1 solution to general privacy")
- configuration files can't be checked by non-techies (but could be used as a signal on privacy transparency - if service hides clues on how to self-check it's privacy credibility or not)

_Product feature_
- "privacy stack" enhancement prototyping (1 solution + 1 solution = privacy "2x" (like Session messenger + dVPN)

**Litecash**	

Answers:
- Litecash is the first fork of BEAM and we tweaked the fees to zero, and less congested to keep lightning-fast transaction along with a sustainable coin supply for mass adoption while keeping inflation resistance. 	
- Our privacy is built on the mimblewimble protocol which is unique compared to other privacy protocols. Litecash transactions are not held on a ledger and disappear as opposed to other methods of scrambling or clustering which could actually be decoded with new wave super computers.	
- if a transfer does not complete due to a wrong address or defunct wallet, funds get sent back to the sender within 24 hours ensuring no lost coins. 			

_Observations_: 
- a fork can be misleading to non-techies mistaking it for a core protocol or misunderstanding as an original product
- third party tech is proven within another community, original protocol engineers &/or researchers which could obscure search on audits, privacy validity
- DeFi features aren't equal privacy features

- forkability x privacy 101
- privacy tech vocabulary (mimblewimble, scrambling, clustering etc)

**Black Box**

- Ergo has the flexibility to implement privacy in various use cases. Although it is not a privacy-oriented blockchain, Sigma Protocols allow privacy-oriented dApps like ErgoMixer, or private side-chains, to obfuscate specific transactions  https://t.co/KVNIk8amD1

_Observations:_ 
- important to understand that protocols could be non-private, but activate private use-cases (partial implementation). Separate core tech from privacy narrative

_Product feature:_
- case-studies (privacy matching): protocol = transparent, but use-cases = private (like Ethereum)
