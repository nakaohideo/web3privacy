# Community feedback x our Scoring model 1.2 version.

**Main goal**: to have an MVP on how non-techies could analyze if the project is private or not.

**Sub-goal**: to have a more objective scoring model made in collaboration with the privacy community.

**Context**:
- _Persona_: a web3 casual user without dev knowledge & privacy illiterate. He/she/they has limited time for research & needs to perform simple steps to ensure that service is private.
- _Assessment categories_: we broke down analytics flow into 2 main categories: validity track (quick check-up) & DYOR (do your own research that requires more time & subjective opinion).

# Sandbox: DeFi category that has been analyzed
