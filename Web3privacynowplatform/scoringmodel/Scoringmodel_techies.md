# MVP for non-techies expanded to techies

**Sandbox: DeFi category that has been analyzed**

**How to use sandbox?**
1. Read scoring assumptions below.
2. Give us feedback via Pull request here.
3. You can always explore [scoring MVP](https://mirror.xyz/0x0f1F3DAf416B74DB3DE55Eb4D7513a80F4841073/90XEXa7AG_qc-VgYKs40i88xB1HF97gr1zqb-qvnif0) based on 38 DeFi project' assessment [here](https://github.com/web3privacy/web3privacy/blob/main/Web3privacynowplatform/scoringmodel/DeFi%20category%20prototype.md)

**important note**: here "techies" covers "juniors" & general "developers" (masses) & not aplicable to "lead", "seniors" or even "mid"-devs (core devs).

# Scoring model 1.2: validity track

_Validity track covers GitHub, Product-readiness, Team, Docs, Audit._

**Note**: quick assessment helps to decrease privacy dark patterns from obscure language to test-net claiming it has a "state of art privacy".

## Sandbox

**Extended scoring 1.0**
| Project | GitHub | Product-readiness | Team | Docs | Audit | Contributors | Licenses | Support | Score |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Test project** | available & active GitHub / not (25%) | Live or üöß (exclusion criteria) | public team / not (25%) | available & not marketing docs / not (25%) | available & up to date third-party audit / not (25%) | external contributors outside of the team members | What licenses are in use | Some form of support available? (telegram, discord, forum) | from 0 to 100% |
| **score** | 12.5% | 12.5% | 12.5% | 12.5% | 12.5% | 12.5% | 12.5% | 12.5% | 100% |

**Updates 1.1**

**GitHub**
* Is it in stable release, 1.0 and not an alpha or untested code?
* Are there many PRs and Issues pending?
* Are there external contributors outside of the team members? [Waku example](https://github.com/waku-org/go-waku)
* What are licenses in use? [Privy Apache-2.0 license](https://github.com/privy-io/shamir-secret-sharing)

**example**: _Free & Open Source Software is the foundation that enables you to check whatever you want. The hoprd client is released under [GPLv3 license](https://github.com/hoprnet/hoprnet/blob/master/LICENSE) that allows you to do that (and also modify and re-distribute) Hoprn freely_

**Docs**
- read the documentation: is it comprehensive?
- how well-written are privacy & security assumptions/guarantees?
- if aplicable: how well-written is encryption method? [example](https://developer.litprotocol.com/v3/sdk/access-control/encryption)
- is Whitepaper marketing or dev-centric?

**Team**
* Check if there are known contributors (reputation 101)
* Check commits at GitHub
* How many community contributors beyond core team?
* How many technical specialists in the team?
* How mature are core contributors (previous projects, GitHub commits)?

**Third-party audit**
- Were bugs fixed? [Zokyo x Railgun_ example, p.7](https://assets.railgun.org/docs/audits/2023-02-03%20Zokyo.pdf)
- How centralized are product updates?
